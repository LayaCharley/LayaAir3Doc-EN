# UI editing module

UI is the abbreviation of User interface, and the Chinese meaning is user interface. For example, progress bars, character avatars, rankings, shopping malls, game tasks, function buttons, etc. in the game interface.

In fact, UI editing refers to a wider scope. All visible 2D display object layouts and interface layout behaviors belong to UI editing.

The UI editing module is an important module for visual operation of 2D games and 2D UI interfaces, which can greatly improve the development efficiency of 2D games and 2D UI production.

The UI editing of LayaAirIDE can realize the separation of UI editing and code, and visual typesetting, so that art and planning without programming foundation can also be learned and mastered.

It also allows programmers to use code to manage and control the UI, as well as implement interaction logic.

UI editing mainly includes hierarchical panels, scene panels, UI editing and layout tools, 2D prefabs, UI widgets (basic display objects, UI components, skeletal animation), etc.

We can view the functional documents of each sub-module separately:
