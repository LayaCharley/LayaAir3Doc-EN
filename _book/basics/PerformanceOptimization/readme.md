# Brief description of LayaAir engine performance optimization

LayaAir is an HTML5 engine that runs on a variety of platforms, including PCs, mobile devices, and tablets. In the context of mobile device hardware performance being weaker than PCs, our need for performance becomes even more important. From the beginning of the design of the LayaAir engine, performance was the first goal and a lot of performance optimization was done in the engine. The performance optimization documentation outlines best practices through code examples and use cases for developers deploying applications.

If developers cannot take advantage of the engine, the final performance experience of the game may not be possible. Therefore, in the process of making games, it is still very necessary to master game and engine optimization skills.
