# About Sound

In LayaNative, sounds are divided into two modes: background music and sound effects.

## 1.Background music

Background music in LayaNative only supports mp3 format, and only one background music can be played at the same time.

## 2.Sound effects

In the project, sound effects are high-frequency events. In order to ensure operating efficiency, LayaNative uses openAL to play sound effects, because mp3 is a streaming media format and cannot be parsed currently.
**Tipsï¼š**  
**1. The sound effects in LayaNative only support wav and ogg formats. **
**2. Wav and ogg only support 8-bit and 16-bit, and do not yet support 32-bit. **

**Tips:** It is recommended to use 22050 sampling rate, 16bit, and mono for wav and ogg.

## 3. Prompt information

If you call `SoundManager.playSound()`, but the incoming file format is mp3, a prompt message will pop up as follows:
`The sound only supports wav or ogg format,for optimal performance reason,please refer to the official website document.`  
At this time, you need to convert mp3 to wav or ogg format.


## 4. Solve compatibility

If your project uses mp3 format for sound effects in the web version, but uses wav format in LayaNative. It is recommended that the project be loaded using a configuration file, so that it is only used where the configuration file is loaded, and is added once to determine whether it is a LayaNative operating environment. The pseudo code is as follows:

```javascript
if(window.conch)
{
	...load "soundConfig-LayaPlayer.json"
}
else
{
	...load "soundConfig-json"
}
SoundManager.playSound(soundJson[0].url,1);
....
SoundManager.playSound(soundJson[1].url,1);
```

**Tips**  
*1. Conch can only be called in the LayaNative environment. There is no definition of conch in the web version, so you need to check whether it exists. *
*2. If you use the as language to develop, you can obtain the conch object through `Browser.window['conch'] `. *
*3. Or you can use `if(Render.isConchApp)` to make a judgment. *

## 5. Use Cool Edit Pro tool to convert sound formats

**When this happens, you can search cool edit resample.xfm on Baidu, or buy genuine cool edit, or. . . (You know)**

**10. If the cool edit pro downloaded online does not have batch conversion, you can convert it first and then batch conversion will happen**
