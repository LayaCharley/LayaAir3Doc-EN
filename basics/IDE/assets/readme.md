# Project resource panel description



## 1. Resource directory

After opening the project in LayaAir IDE, it consists of five parts. The effect is shown in Figure 1-1.

<img src="img/1-1.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

(Picture 1-1)

- Project resource directory
- Project source code directory
- `+` quick creation
- Search panel
- Catalog setting button

First, we can briefly understand the project resource directory and project source code directory, and then give a detailed introduction to the other three functions.



## 1.1 Project resource directory assets

The assets directory is a relatively important project directory. All our scenes and resources are in the assets directory. The IDE's management of project resources comes from this directory.

The effect is shown in Figure 1-2:

<img src="img/1-2.png" style="zoom: 50%;" />

(Figure 1-2)

This catalog is closely linked to the final release,

For example, resources introduced in assets in the scene will be automatically copied to the publishing directory.

The resources referenced in the code must be placed in the resources directory before they will be copied to the release directory.



## 1.2 Project source code directory src

The source code directory in src is shown in Figure 1-3.

<img src="img/1-3.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

(Figure 1-3)

The source code directory is relatively easy to understand. Usually after installing the code editor, you can double-click the source code to open the code editor.



## 1.3 Right-click menu

By right-clicking any directory or file, you can open the menu, as shown in Figure 1-4

 <img src="img/1-4.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

(Figure 1-4)

By clicking "Create", a "Lightmap Baking Settings" file is created in the assets directory in animation 1-5.

<img src="img/1-5.gif" style="zoom: 80%;" />  

(Animation 1-5)

In the second section, we will explain the types that can be created in the menu. Next, we will introduce other options:

**Open in File Manager**: You can quickly open the file manager to view the file.

**Find references in the scene**: You can search for components that reference this resource. You can view the document ["Hierarchy Panel Description"] (../../../basics/IDE/Hierarchy/readme.md) Section 2.2.

**Rename, delete, copy, paste**: basic operations on files, no need to go into details.

**Generate Copy**: You can generate a copy that retains the attributes of the original file.

**Reimport**: Usually used when the import fails, or some external dependencies have changed. For example, there is a material in the model, and the material refers to an external texture, but the texture was not put in at first, but later it was put in. You can use this function .

**Open project in code editor**: You can directly open the code editor to view file information.



## 1.4 Edit 2D pictures into sprite textures

2D image resources, in the assets directory, will be used as the texture format of the 3D model by default. In 2D interface development, it usually needs to be changed to a 2D image format, which needs to be edited by the developer.

As shown in Figure 1-6, this is a png picture with a transparent channel

<img src="img/1-6.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

(Figure 1-6)

Click on the picture to see the property settings, as shown in Figure 1-7

<img src="img/1-7.png"  />

(Figure 1-7)

`Default value`: By default, the image is used as the Texture map file of the 3D model and can only be used on the material ball.

`Sprite texture`: The picture is a picture texture format of a 2D Sprite object, usually used in 2D development. This attribute is automatically used as the sprite texture when the image resource is named according to the official naming rules. Otherwise, it is the default value, which will cause the resource to display abnormally.

Without changing the image type, use and run this image as a 2D image in the Image component. The page background is blue, as shown in Figure 1-8.

<img src="img/1-8.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

(Figure 1-8)

You can see that there are white burrs in the green area in the picture, so the settings need to be changed, as shown in Figure 1-9

<img src="img/1-9.png"  />

(Figure 1-9)

Letâ€™s take a look at the running effect, as shown in Figure 1-10

<img src="img/1-10.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

(Figure 1-10)

The image also has some other property settings:

`Tiling mode`: Select the way the texture is tiled. The default option is repeat.

`Filter Mode`: Select how the texture is filtered when stretched by 3D transformations. The default is bilinear filtering.

`Texture Flip`: Flip the image.

`Texture rotation`: Rotate the image.

`Non-power of 2 scaling`: When the texture is not a power of 2, the operation mode is scaled to the power of 2.

`Readable and writable`: When enabled, texture pixels can be dynamically read using scripts.

Skin related settings:

`Nine Gongge`: Nine Gongge information.

`Button skin state`: The number of states of the button skin.

For the texture format, please refer to the document ["Texture Compression"](../../../IDE/uiEditor/textureCompress/readme.md).



## 2. Quickly create files

There are two quick ways to create files quickly

- **Click `+` to create quickly**
- **Click on the blank space to quickly create**
